This project aims to calculate signature functions for knots (cable sums) and was used to prove Lemma 3.2 from a paper "On the slice genus of generalized algebraic knots" (Maria Marchwicka and Wojciech Politarczyk). 
The program can be run as a sage script from the terminal  (file main.sage in gaknot) or used in interactive mode (see notebooks for examples). 

A knot (cable sum) is encoded as a list where each element (also a list) corresponds to a cable knot.
