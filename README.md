This project allows calculating knot invariants for linear combinations of iterated torus knots. 
It was created as part of proof for the main lemma from a paper "On the slice genus of generalized algebraic knots" (Maria Marchwicka and Wojciech Politarczyk).

To recreate calculations that were done for the proof see lemma.ipynb in notebooks.
For a more detailed description see package documentation.
